SDL_Input_TTF_Display()

Name
	SDL_Input_TTF_Display -- Renders and blit input text

Synopsis
	#include "SDL_Input_TTF.h"
	int SDL_Input_TTF_Display( SDL_Input_TTF *ttf, SDL_Surface *dest,
		SDL_Surface *backSpace );

Description
	ttf			-- SDL_Input_TTF pointer;
	dest		-- SDL_Surface on which everything will be blit. Generally
					speaking, this should always be the result of
					SDL_GetVideoSurface() (so-called "screen");
	backSpace	-- Surface to be blit under rendered text;

	First, this function does some basic error checking (checks if SDL video
		subsystem was init, if SDL_TTF was init, if ttf->font is NULL and if
		ttf->input->string is NULL ). It also checks ttf->position.w value.
		Shall the latter be invalid (lesser than 1 or greater than dest->w), it
		will be reset to dest->w - ttf->position.x - 1.
	Shall ttf->input->string be empty, nothing will be blit.
	Shall backSpace not be NULL, it will be blit on dest at position
		ttf->position.
	Finally, offset is computed, string is blit and cursor is blit.

Return Value
	Returns 0 or -1 if it fails.

Undefined Behaviour
	The behaviour is undefined if one of the following occurs:

Possible Failure Reasons
	-SDL video subsystem wasn't init;
	-TTF wasn't init;
	-ttf->font evaluates to NULL;
	-ttf->input->string evaluates to NULL;
	TO BE COMPLETED
