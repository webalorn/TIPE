== Random key generation ==

- Add random keys to WOT file.
- Find out statistical properties of real sets.
- Find out ways to generate real-looking sets.
- Try to find suspicious subsets in the real WOT.

== Key removal ==

- Try to remove random keys and see how much it splits the network.

== Per country ==

- Estimate the distance within TLD subsets, within random subsets, between each other.
- Find out the country of a key from its distance to the subsets.
- Generate a map of keys, coloured by subsets and by MSD. Ideas include :
  * Use a key as center, draw circles, study the relative position of keys on circles ;
  * Random layout and successive transpositions to improve the result ;
  * Springs, calculate their mechanical action and try to minimize their potential energy ;
  * Simplexes.


Rearrange selection in various shapes.
Better line drawing!
Better mouse_move handling! (more efficient, highlight in a different color, along with signers and signees)
Clustering coefficient.
Display F and T selection.
Quadtrees, etc.?

Antisprings (between a key and the keys which are the furthest away from it)
