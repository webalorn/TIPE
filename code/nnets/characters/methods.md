Siamese Networks	score comparison, dissimilarity measure
Attention LSTM (attLSTM)	better extraction of prior data, contains order-dependence of input data
Iterative Refinement LSTMs (IterRefLSTM)	similar to attLSTM, but removes all order dependence of data by iteratively evolving the query and support embeddings simultaneously in an iterative loop
